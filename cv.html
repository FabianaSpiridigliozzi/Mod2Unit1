        <h4>Description of Pinky and The Brain</h4>
        <p>
          Pinky and the Brain is an American animated television series that was
          created by Tom Ruegger that premiered on Kids' WB on September 9,
          1995. It was the first animated television series to be presented in
          Dolby Surround and the fourth collaboration of Steven Spielberg with
          his production company, Amblin Entertainment, and Warner Bros.
          Animation. The characters first appeared in 1993 as a recurring skit
          on Animaniacs. It was later spun off as a series due to its
          popularity, with 66 episodes produced. The characters later appeared
          in the series Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain,[2] and have since returned to
          their roots as an Animaniacs skit in the 2020 revival of that series.

          Pinky and the Brain are genetically enhanced laboratory mice who
          reside in a cage in the Acme Labs research facility. Brain is highly
          intelligent, self-centered and scheming, while Pinky is good-natured
          but feeble-minded. In each episode, Brain devises a new plan to take
          over the world which ultimately ends in failure, usually due to the
          impossibility of Brain's plan, Brain's own overconfidence, Pinky's
          bumbling, an oversight on Brain's part, circumstances beyond their
          control, or multiples thereof. In common with many other Animaniacs
          shorts, many episodes are in some way a parody of something else,
          usually a film or novel.
